A manga website template I am working on in my past time, Currently stopped as I try to learn JavaScript.

Release Version works but has many bugs, for instance:
  Deleting Series or Chapter requires clicking delete multiple times.
  CSS isnt responsive.
  Code is very dirty.
  Website is vulnerable.
  
Release is missing files, I do not wish for others to use this template from here.
